# Hi, I’m Andy 👋

I’m a technical consultant focused on helping SaaS companies improve how their systems work together. My work sits between business needs and technical execution, with an emphasis on integrations, API workflows, and reliable data movement.

I enjoy breaking down complex systems, understanding how tools connect, and designing solutions that are clear, scalable, and dependable for the teams that rely on them.

## 🧩 What I Do
- Integration and workflow design for SaaS platforms
- API testing and validation (Postman, REST APIs)
- EDI and system integration testing
- Python scripting for automation and data handling
- Translating business requirements into practical technical solutions
- Supporting customer-facing and internal technical projects

## 🧠 How I Work
I’m calm under pressure, curious by default, and focused on clarity. I prefer understanding the root cause of a problem rather than applying quick fixes, and I aim to leave systems easier to support than I found them.
